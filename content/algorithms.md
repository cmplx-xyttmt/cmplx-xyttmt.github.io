# Algorithms and Competitive Programming.
After a two-year break from competitive programming, I'm diving back in. My goal this time around is more than just solving problems; I want to refresh my knowledge, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and become a more articulate and thoughtful programmer.

In the past, I often solved problems in bulk, rarely taking time for post-solution reflection or documentation. While that approach boosted my problem count, I believe it hindered my long-term progress and deeper understanding. This time, I'm committed to being more deliberate.

My main motivations for this blog series are twofold: to improve my problem-solving abilities and to enhance my technical writing and articulation skills. I've learned from past technical interviews that a lack of clarity in expressing my thought process can be a significant roadblock. I'm hoping that the act of writing about these problems will improve both my problem-solving skills and my ability to communicate technical ideas effectively.

Below is a list of articles in this series:

      <description>Following up on my last post, we&amp;rsquo;re diving into another challenge from Atcoder&amp;rsquo;s Beginner Contest 407: Problem C, titled &amp;ldquo;Security 2&amp;rdquo;. This problem was more approachable than Problem D, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even included an interactive visualization to help you explore its mechanics.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the problem, play with the mechanics and I&amp;rsquo;ll describe my solution approach.&#xA;The Problem You can find the full problem description here. But here&amp;rsquo;s the gist of it.</description>

      <description>In this article, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at Problem D: Domino Covering XOR from AtCoder Beginner Contest 407. When I first attempted this problem, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to solve it on my own. My initial approach led me down a rabbit hole: attempting to maximize the XOR by strategically choosing which numbers to exclude, bit by bit, from most significant to least. This quickly proved difficult to implement, as removing a single number (by covering it with a domino) necessarily meant covering an adjacent one as well.</description>

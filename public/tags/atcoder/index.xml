      <description>The Problem At the entrance of AtCoder Inc., there is a special pass-code input device. The device consists of a screen displaying one string, and two buttons.&#xA;Let tt be the string shown on the screen. Initially, tt is the empty string. Pressing a button changes tt as follows:&#xA;Pressing button A appends 0 to the end of tt. Pressing button B replaces every digit in tt with the next digit: for digits 0 through 8 the next digit is the one whose value is larger by 1; the next digit after 9 is 0.</description>

      <description>In this article, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at Problem D: Domino Covering XOR from AtCoder Beginner Contest 407. When I first attempted this problem, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to solve it on my own. My initial approach led me down a rabbit hole: attempting to maximize the XOR by strategically choosing which numbers to exclude, bit by bit, from most significant to least. This quickly proved difficult to implement, as removing a single number (by covering it with a domino) necessarily meant covering an adjacent one as well.</description>

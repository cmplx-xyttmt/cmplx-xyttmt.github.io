      <description>In this article, we look at another problem from Atcoder&amp;rsquo;s Beginner Contest 407: Problem C, titled &amp;ldquo;Security 2&amp;rdquo;. This problem was easier than problem D (discussed in my previous post), and I&amp;rsquo;ve also included an interactive visualization for the device in the problem.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the problem, play with the mechanics and I&amp;rsquo;ll describe my solution approach.&#xA;The Problem You can find the full problem description here. But here&amp;rsquo;s the gist of it.</description>

      <description>In this article, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at Problem D: Domino Covering XOR from AtCoder Beginner Contest 407. When I first attempted this problem, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to solve it on my own. My initial approach led me down a rabbit hole: attempting to maximize the XOR by strategically choosing which numbers to exclude, bit by bit, from most significant to least. This quickly proved difficult to implement, as removing a single number (by covering it with a domino) necessarily meant covering an adjacent one as well.</description>

      <description>Algorithms and Competitive Programming. After a two-year break from competitive programming, I&amp;rsquo;m diving back in. My goal this time around is more than just solving problems; I want to refresh my knowledge, sharpen my problem-solving skills, and become a more articulate and thoughtful programmer.&#xA;In the past, I often solved problems in bulk, rarely taking time for post-solution reflection or documentation. While that approach boosted my problem count, I believe it hindered my long-term progress and deeper understanding.</description>
